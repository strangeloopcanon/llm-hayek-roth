# Preference density × mechanism: an LLM-enabled regime shift test

So what: this repo runs a minimal, reproducible 2×2 “field-experiment analog” showing how **LLM-based elicitation** can make preferences *easier to infer* and lower the ROI threshold (λ*) at which **centralized recommendations/matching** becomes worthwhile relative to decentralized search.

<details>
<summary>Why this matters</summary>

This project is inspired by Peng Shi, “Optimal Matchmaking Strategy in Two-sided Marketplaces” (SSRN 3536086; see References).

Search is the “backup plan” when the platform can’t confidently pick the right match for you.
We make you scroll/filter/message because the system doesn’t really understand what you want.

This repo tests a mechanism-design claim: if an AI intake can reliably turn messy human intent into a structured spec, then the platform can move from “you search” to “we recommend/match” in categories where search is costly.

What we measure:
- How accurately the platform can infer who you’ll accept (a proxy for “describability”).
- How much communication/attention is spent to get a match.
- The ROI boundary `λ*` where centralized matching starts to beat search (central wins if `λ > λ*`).

Money/prices:
- The “realistic” simulation layer (`make field-v2`) includes explicit budgets, quotes, and surplus/profit accounting.

<summary>Regime map (k_I × k_J)</summary>

```bash
make regime
```

This sweeps elicitation depth for customers (k_I) and providers (k_J) and plots where
centralized recommendations beat search on net welfare, and the implied ROI boundary (λ*).
